they are the best snack thin and healthy look we want healthy i don't really bodies eat healthy but i brains don't really eat here healthy like i don't care for healthy snacks ah you don't mmm care for health no like i i think kind of a waste of money alright so what are you looking yeah for i in a snack think we should have like ice cream ice cream is not <unknown/> a snack i think is a snack <fl/> chocolate bars no ok then at least we have a soft-serve machine we can have oh like that's an idea uh goat's mmm milk how about goat's popcorn goat's milk milk ice how cream goat's about popcorn milk ice yeah machine cream mmm that's popcorn right is nice yeah popcorn popcorn's it machine stinks very healthy out as long the as office you don't pour like butter you can't on it believe that's right stinks thank you out the office yeah it yeah it's does true but uh i it's that's i a can't but pleasant true it smells smell so good yeah wouldn't you want it the office smell uh to smell like popcorn popcorn someone's is with a very butter pleasant smell brings ugh ok our so childhood no popcorn and uh no unhealthy snacks what am i supposed to eat no no no no natural popcorn without the butter that's <unknown/> no that's you fine need that's the not butter it's not you need popcorn the unhealthy then part about ok it uh popcorn so without you're talking butter about candy and things candy like that sour patch does uh that <filllaugh/> mean twizzlers that we have hmm wait wait wait but do we ok then <unknown/> that's just like does <fill/> that mean that just we have corrupts to everyone else i know that we have the budget well people but that's can have self control i want my unhealthy snacks ok does that well mean keep also them in because your drawer we have the budget that we have to remodel the kitchen to mmm uh to be able to uh get remodel all of that no no well no we don't <fill/> have <unknown/> we enough uh <unknown/> we need that for all for snacks people are hungry i know but we don't have enough enough food to store all of that do we need more storage do we need more cabinets oh we have do the budget we no need well <fill/> another we've got the refrigerator walk-in fridges already that's our big product right maybe we can just bring in another walk-in fridge i no suggest that we have a barista let's say in the morning hours of the that's and a nice and then absolutely the barista turns into a an ice-cream soda maker <filllaugh/> let's yeah say about uh now uh just <unknown/> after lunch so people can have something sweet and that can carry em on for the for the rest of that's the day really healthy ok mmm that's yes that sounds good that actually sounds that's good really you don't healthy that yeah like that sounds good yes yes i'm yes i'm thinking about your uh your yeah calorie requirements right uh yeah there and we have to think seriously about people's caffeine requirements mmm yeah that's people the baristo in the office i think everyone drinks like at least four mmm cups a day and yeah is this healthy yeah it's not they healthy want but us to do drink are that we taking care of their health or are we just taking care of what both they want both both because hmm we don't we know what sugar up does up to you to four well cups after a i day think lunch is considered then puts if we you gonna ok to sleep have these baristas in this then i want a real sushi <unknown/> station as well sushi sushi mmm sushi's is not oh a snack too that's a good idea there's is an it's that idea a a snack total snack k and it's the healthiest food in this world yeah and it keeps but that me motivated means it again really so gives like having a sashimi buffet yeah all times again again then we need to upgrade our kitchen mmm no so it takes it's more up such a little <unknown/> not space uh i not mean we do have a not <fill/> pretty that drastically big budget that we can add another few islands and maybe it's for a way me of also using the product you <unknown/> know we could have the robot make the for uh the the sushi sushi me make the sushi uh on for the side me that's and i right then <fill/> i with think the <fill/> our uh snacks conveyor is belt something that uh uh technology for me something right for me snacks running is sushi we something that <fill/> we can can use stay it overnight for product research without uh getting ruined so uh i don't see sushi like an option because it's a snack is a snack is a snack it mmm has to be able to be well uh kept well we can list well let's then let's what about list our dim the sum uh the different uh things robot that we're looking for uh wagon so <fill/> so coming around to our desks so beth you wanted like sushi the tea lady yeah maybe alright so <fill/> so so <fill/> rachel who you wanted to you wanted to talk about more kitchen remodeling uh we need a no quote we need <unknown/> a quote for that for how let's much that would do be that one <fill/> at the next meeting we'll have ok the list of the new snacks we want to bring in that need to be you know maybe storage differently and then we'll uh fix ok uh i'll so the <unknown/> you uh sort the remodel that uh out i'll by i'll the say twenty fifth i'll take a look and see if there are specialists in <unknown/> ice-cream soda making please that uh that we can bring ok in how much it'll cost to rent them and for then two the dim three sum hours wagon a day i'll speak to our tech guy because we can put one of our products on the floor yeah and that would we can ok do quality control like that as well great yeah that's a good ok idea great good good idea now mmm are we gonna bring this to a vote with all the employees or is this going oh be i decided just by us i think if we bring it to a vote it's gonna be too controversial nobody right i think will ever agree on right anything yeah no exactly yeah so yeah yeah we're gonna make the decision for the whole yeah we'll company make <unknown/> the decision yeah we'll if make people the decision leave the company because of it yeah well are we that's gonna bring uh it to a vote in our group can i we think do that we kind next of week already uh talked no it out i didn't hear the vote mmm do we want to put it uh for vote next week we yes can let's let's bring think it to about a vote next it and week next week we'll ok bring it to a vote next in week our group next week once once we have a little bit more ok data about and if what's you wanna available share ok with the person next to you at uh at work
